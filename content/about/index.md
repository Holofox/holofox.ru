Since 2022, Holofox has been publishing articles about the development of Flutter and more. All the presented content is publicly available and is intended for developers who are interested in mobile development.

The site is managed by me, Abdrafikov Danil. I like being a mentor and helping people with their questions, moreover, I am insanely dependent on clean code and immaculately built architecture.

I am sure that there will be useful material on the site that will change your approach to development. In any case, I will be glad if you [contact]({{< ref "contact" >}}) me if you have any questions.

Thank you for reading this, I hope you enjoy it!
