Hi, let's get acquainted!

My name is Danil, I am a Flutter developer who came from native mobile development to cross-platform. I have
very often had the idea to start a personal blog with interesting thoughts to help people with the answer to some
questions.

In real life, I participate in conferences where I share topics with people that I find very interesting and important.
Realizing that not all people can understand the technical component of the topic at such events, I try to choose the
one that would be common to any developer, manager, designer, etc.

However, if you are a beginner or an advanced specialist, the material will be useful in any case.

Articles will be both on a general topic and on highly specialized ones related to the field of mobile development. I
will try to share the solutions that I have to come to during the development of large projects.

That's all, you can start the journey!
