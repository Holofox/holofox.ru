Since 2022, Holofox has been publishing articles about development on Flutter and beyond. All the presented content is
publicly available and is intended for people who are interested in this topic.

The blog is managed by me, Abdrafikov Danil. I like being a mentor and helping people with their questions, moreover, I
am insanely dependent on clean code and immaculately built architecture.

I am sure that there will be useful material on the site that will change your approach to development. In any case, I
will be glad if you [contact]({{< ref "contact" >}}) me if you have any questions.

Thank you for reading this, I hope you enjoy it!
